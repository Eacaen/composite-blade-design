## Composite Material Calculation with CLT
* The main package is a Python composite materials calculation package.
The laminate stresses, strain and failure Criterion based on the Classical Lamination Theory ([CLT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_laminates)).  

	- You can define the lamina's fibre and matrix's parameters like the Elastic moduli
	![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?E_{1},E_{2}),
	 Shear moduli ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?G) and strength, then define lamina's layer angle and thickness in the next step.
		
	- After define the lamina you can get the matrix such as ![A,B,D,Q](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?A,B,D,Q,\\bar{Q}) and so on by use the ***Laminate class*** or you can define the laminate directly.

	- Use the ***Load class*** and load the force and moment to the laminate to calculate the stress ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\\sigma) and stain ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\\epsilon) of each lamina.

	- Use the ***Failure_Cirterion class*** and you can choose different theories to check witch lamina failure or not.

* The *laminate_plugin.py* can plot the stress and strain distribution in the laminate in the COS(xy or 12), print the results in _Excel_ formate and save it in _Excel_.

## Engineer Beam Calculation with open or closed profile
* You need to distinguish the shape of the profile, open, closed or mixed and choose the right functions to calculate.
	* You can give the coordinate value of the points of the profile in a _Excel_ table, you may also need to add or remove some edges, change the thickness between the edges of the profile generated by the ***read_exe class***

	* Use the ***profile_constant class*** to calculate the profile's engineer constant like the second moment of area 
	![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?I_{x},I_{y},I_{xy}) and use the parameters in the next steps, you can also choose whether move the profile to its centroid.

	* If the profile is a open one, you can use the ***open_profile class*** directly, it can calculate the 
	![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?S_{x},S_{y}) and the give the _Shear Flow_ distribution under the shear force ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?Q_{x},Q_{y}) along the path you choose and you can get the shear center if need.  
	* If the profile is a close one with more than one close cells, you need to choose cut points to make the profile become a open one, then choose the integrate paths and use the ***open_profile class*** to get the shear flow in the 'open' profile. Last,  use the functions in ***close_profile.py*** to get the shear flow in each close cell, get the shear center, get the twist angle and some more results you need.

* There are many different kind of plug-ins you can use to help you plot the results in 2D or 3D.
